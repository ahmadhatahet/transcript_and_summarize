# Transcript and Summarize:

1. Record audio from microphone with set of constrains
2. Transcript the audio into text files
3. collect all text then send it to OpenAI for summarizaiton
4. Return and save the response


### Todos:
1. Multi language support (EN, DE, AR).
2. Add options to the UI for faster modifications.
3. Try to work in parallel( while speaking each created file get transcripted then sent to summarization)<br />This point needs longer duration. Here the limitaion of Google Model to transcript text must be taken into account.
